# ApexSearchBrowser
A tool for Phoenix 2 (iOS game) to search for information on all Apexes in the game, using your browser

No installation is required for this search app, all you need is any modern browser (i.e. pretty much anything other than Internet Explorer).

Download the app at [this link](https://github.com/Elegater/ApexSearchBrowser/archive/v0.1.zip).
Once you have it unzipped and saved on your computer, open ApexSearch.html (and if it asks you to select a program to open it, just select a browser of your choice) and you're in!

Usage instructions:
You can search for text in any column using the search bar (except for descriptions). Click on a column header to sort by that column (both ascending and descending order are possible).
